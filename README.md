Capital Connect web project is develope as begineer level project

No framework is used in this project, All the files and content of this project is unstructured

### Initial objective during project development was to develop a working and funtional web application with Appealing Frontend.

For initializing and setting things locally follow below steps:

step 1) install xampp and use apache server for localhost

step 2) create rn_8164 database in phpmyadmin page and then import database file into rn_8164 database

step 3) paste website folder into " xampp/htdocs " folder

step 4) open xampp and start apache server and mysql , then into browser open localhost:80/capitalconnect

## we encouraged to forked this repo and contribute by making this project well structured using framework
suggestion :- use laravel framework, enable remote sql database support,


Still if u need any help then contact owner of this repo i.e. me Raj Nandale
